First soltuion in script.js is wrong 
We get the biggest squares first not  the least number 

example 
12 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 - wrong solution 
12 = 4 + 4 + 4 - correct future solution 
______________________________________________
Next idea

Get the combination of all different numbers / sums that lead to 12 
you only need the number of additions not the solution itself
